# AR-Shooting-game
An AR game programmed after learning AR/VR
Project Outline
This project is a set of AR games. The first game is a balloon shooting game. It was following the tutorial on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzmBnllRnh8&list=LL&index=4&t=165s. The second game is the shooting alien game. The picture below is the menu interface which is the menu scene in the project. And the platform is the Unity 2019.4.32.
 
In the first game, you can see the clock on the left side of the screen, and the score table on the middle upper of the screen. If your aim is on the balloon, press the fire button. You will find the balloon is destroyed and the “boom” sound will be played. Also, a smoke effect will be showed on the screen. This is implemented in the Game1 scene.

Then we go to the Game2 scene. We have the score table and the HP bar on the screen. The enemy will be generated randomly, and if we cannot shoot them before they explode (too close to the player), our HP bar will drop. Also, each enemy will cost two bullets to be killed. This time player can just tap on the screen to shoot the enemy.
